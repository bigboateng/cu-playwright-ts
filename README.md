# Computer Use Playwright SDK

A TypeScript SDK that combines Anthropic's Computer Use capabilities with Playwright for browser automation tasks. This SDK provides a clean, type-safe interface for automating browser interactions using Claude's computer use abilities.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Simple API**: Single `ComputerUseAgent` class for all computer use tasks
- üîÑ **Dual Response Types**: Support for both text and structured (JSON) responses
- üõ°Ô∏è **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with Zod schema validation
- ‚ö° **Optimized**: Clean error handling and robust JSON parsing
- üéØ **Focused**: Clean API surface with sensible defaults

## Installation

```bash
npm install cu-playwright-ts
# or
yarn add cu-playwright-ts
# or
bun add cu-playwright-ts
```

## Quick Start

```typescript
import { chromium } from 'playwright';
import { ComputerUseAgent } from 'cu-playwright-ts';

const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: false });
const page = await browser.newPage();

// Navigate to Hacker News manually first
await page.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com/");

const agent = new ComputerUseAgent({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!,
  page,
});

// Simple text response
const answer = await agent.execute('Tell me the title of the top story');
console.log(answer);

await browser.close();
```

## API Reference

### `ComputerUseAgent`

The main class for computer use automation.

#### Constructor

```typescript
new ComputerUseAgent(options: {
  apiKey: string;
  page: Page;
  model?: string;
})
```

**Parameters:**
- `apiKey` (string): Your Anthropic API key. Get one from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- `page` (Page): Playwright page instance to control
- `model` (string, optional): Anthropic model to use. Defaults to `'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022'`

**Supported Models:**
See [Anthropic's Computer Use documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool#model-compatibility) for the latest model compatibility.

#### `execute()` Method

```typescript
async execute<T = string>(
  query: string,
  schema?: z.ZodSchema<T>,
  options?: {
    systemPromptSuffix?: string;
    thinkingBudget?: number;
  }
): Promise<T>
```

**Parameters:**

- **`query`** (string): The task description for Claude to execute
  
- **`schema`** (ZodSchema, optional): Zod schema for structured responses. When provided, the response will be validated against this schema
  
- **`options`** (object, optional):
  - **`systemPromptSuffix`** (string): Additional instructions appended to the system prompt
  - **`thinkingBudget`** (number): Token budget for Claude's internal reasoning process. Default: `1024`. See [Extended Thinking documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking) for details

**Returns:** 
- `Promise<T>`: When `schema` is provided, returns validated data of type `T`
- `Promise<string>`: When no `schema` is provided, returns the text response

## Usage Examples

### Text Response

```typescript
import { ComputerUseAgent } from 'cu-playwright-ts';

// Navigate to the target page first
await page.goto("https://news.ycombinator.com/");

const agent = new ComputerUseAgent({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!,
  page,
});

const result = await agent.execute(
  'Tell me the title of the top story on this page'
);
console.log(result); // "Title of the top story"
```

### Structured Response with Zod

```typescript
import { z } from 'zod';
import { ComputerUseAgent } from 'cu-playwright-ts';

const agent = new ComputerUseAgent({
  apiKey: process.env.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY!,
  page,
});

const HackerNewsStory = z.object({
  title: z.string(),
  points: z.number(),
  author: z.string(),
  comments: z.number(),
  url: z.string().optional(),
});

const stories = await agent.execute(
  'Get the top 5 Hacker News stories with their details',
  z.array(HackerNewsStory).max(5)
);

console.log(stories);
// [
//   {
//     title: "Example Story",
//     points: 150,
//     author: "user123",
//     comments: 42,
//     url: "https://example.com"
//   },
//   ...
// ]
```

### Advanced Options

```typescript
const result = await agent.execute(
  'Complex task requiring more thinking',
  undefined, // No schema for text response
  {
    systemPromptSuffix: 'Be extra careful with form submissions.',
    thinkingBudget: 4096, // More thinking tokens for complex tasks
  }
);
```

## Environment Setup

1. **Anthropic API Key**: Set your API key as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Playwright**: Install Playwright and browser dependencies:
   ```bash
   npx playwright install
   ```

## Computer Use Parameters

This SDK leverages Anthropic's Computer Use API with the following key parameters:

### Model Selection
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Best balance of speed and capability for most tasks
- **Claude 4 Models**: Enhanced reasoning with extended thinking capabilities
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet**: Advanced reasoning with thinking transparency

### Thinking Budget
The `thinkingBudget` parameter controls Claude's internal reasoning process:
- **1024 tokens** (default): Suitable for simple tasks
- **4096+ tokens**: Better for complex reasoning tasks
- **16k+ tokens**: Recommended for highly complex multi-step operations

See [Anthropic's Extended Thinking guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/extended-thinking#working-with-thinking-budgets) for optimization tips.

## Error Handling

The SDK includes built-in error handling:

```typescript
try {
  const result = await agent.execute('Your task here');
  console.log(result);
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('No response received')) {
    console.log('Agent did not receive a response from Claude');
  } else {
    console.log('Other error:', error.message);
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use specific, clear instructions**: "Click the red 'Submit' button" vs "click submit"

2. **For complex tasks, break them down**: Use step-by-step instructions in your query

3. **Optimize thinking budget**: Start with default (1024) and increase for complex tasks

4. **Handle errors gracefully**: Implement proper error handling for production use

5. **Use structured responses**: When you need specific data format, use Zod schemas

6. **Test in headless: false**: During development, run with visible browser to debug

## Security Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Computer use can interact with any visible application. Always:

- Run in isolated environments (containers/VMs) for production
- Avoid providing access to sensitive accounts or data
- Review Claude's actions in logs before production deployment
- Use allowlisted domains when possible

See [Anthropic's Computer Use Security Guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/tool-use/computer-use-tool#security-considerations) for detailed security recommendations.
